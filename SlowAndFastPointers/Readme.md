Fast and Slow Pointers

One pointer moves 1 space, the other moves 2.  Use this pattern to find middle of a list or a cycle in the list.
This pattern is fast:  O(1)

When to use it?
Linear data structures (arrays, lists, strings)

Detect cycle in **linked list**

Find middle of **linked list**

Perform in one pass with O(1) space
