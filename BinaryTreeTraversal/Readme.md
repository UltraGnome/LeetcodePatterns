### Binary Tree Traversal

For the preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals use recursion (DFS). For the level by level 
scan use BFS iteratively with a queue.

When to use it?
Preorder: Serialize or deserialize a tree

Inorder: Retrieve elements in sorted order (BSTs)

Postorder: Process children before parent (bottom-up)

BFS: Level by level scanning
