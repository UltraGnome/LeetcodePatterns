Two Pointers

When you need to scan an array use two pointers to traverse instead of looping.  This is particularly effective for finding palindromes.



When to use?
    
    Linear data structures (arrays, lists, strings)
    
    When you need to scan the start and end of a list
    
    When you have a sorted list and need to find pairs
    
    Removing duplicates or filtering
